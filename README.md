# Barely Engine

This is a very simple graphics (plus a bit more) built because I wanted to learn more about OpenGL and how game/graphics engines are built. I also wanted to improve my C++ knowledge and learn to write modern C++11 (and use some nice things from C++14).

Currently, the engine only supports OS X and OpenGL 3.3, but I will add support for Windows shortly.

## Building

Eventually I'll include projects for Xcode, Windows and a generic Makefile. Maybe in the future I'll automate all that with CMake...

#### Xcode

I have included an Xcode project which allows you to build a static library. It expects my [BarelyGL](https://github.com/adamransom/barely_gl) repo to be in the same directory, as it includes the Xcode project from that repo.

## Usage & Examples

More will come here shortly, I promise!

I'll include an example "app" showing how the basics work. However, really this engine was only built as a learning exercise. It's probably more useful to browse the code (which I tried to comment heavily) if you're hoping to learn a little about OpenGL.
